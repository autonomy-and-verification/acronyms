# Acronyms
## Matt Luckcuck

Acronyms used within the network, as Latex acronyms.

acronyms.tex is a Latex file of acronyms compatible with the glassaries package. It was generated by a simple (probably dodgy) [tool I wrote](https://github.com/mluckcuck/CSV2GLS) that converted them from csv files of acronyms.

To use it, add:
`\usepackage[xindy]{glossaries}`
`\loadglsentries{acronyms}`

to the document preamble and copy acronyms.tex into the root source folder for the document. The glossaries package can be found on [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/glossaries) aong with its documentation.
